## Gardenstores Project

- Inspired by an onsite coding challenge at a potential employer, I built the whole thing anew at home.
- And, not too surprising - the more relaxed the mind, the better the result ğŸŒ¸

### Tech Stack

- I used create-react-app to bootstrap this project.
- The styling is pure & self-built CSS ğŸ§¡ğŸ’œğŸ’™
